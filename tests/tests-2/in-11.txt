Dogma? I am God.
Dont nod.
Drab as a fool, aloof as a bard.
Draw, o coward!
Drawer as a reward.
Ed, I saw Harpo Marx ram Oprah W. aside.
Emil saw a slime.
Eva can ignite virtuosos out riveting in a cave.
Eva, can I see bees in a cave?
Evade me, Dave.
Evil, I did dwell, lewd did I live.
Flee to me, remote elf.
Gateman sees name, garageman sees name tag.
Geronimo, no minor ego.
Gert, I saw Ron avoid a radio-van, or was it Reg?
Go deliver a dare, vile dog!
God save Evas dog.
God! A red nugget! A fat egg under a dog!
I did, did I?
If I had a Hi-Fi.
